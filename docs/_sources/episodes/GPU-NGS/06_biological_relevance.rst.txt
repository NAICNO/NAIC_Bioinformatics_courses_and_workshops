Biological relevance
--------------------

-  One of the main objectives of a sequence analysis workflows is to
   detect DNA changes in an individual
-  CPU workflow is the current standard for NGS data analysis
-  In ordert to assess the reliability of GPU pipline,

   -  We studied to what extent the GPU-only pipeline detect same set of
      DNA changes identified in CPU-only pipeline?

DNA changes identified in two pipelines
---------------------------------------

-  Intersection of DNA changes detected in GPU-only and CPU-only
   pipelines

-  Percentage of DNA changes that are

   -  common to both pipelines: 98.24% - 99.69%
   -  unique to each pipeline: 0.06% - 1.2%
