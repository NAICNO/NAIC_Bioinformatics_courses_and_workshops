Deep learning use case in genomics
==================================

Objective
---------

-  Choose a use case where machine learning (ML) technique is used to
   solve a genomics problem.

   -  AlphaMissense - implements a deep learning model to predict the
      pathogenicity of DNA changes that alter protein sequence.

-  Present a genomics scientistâ€™s perspective of the ML workflow
   implemented in the use-case. i.e., genomics interpretation of the
   AlphaMissense deep learning workflow.
-  Main focus is to highlight the importance of ML in solving genomics
   problems and not to promote AlphaMissense as a clinically viable
   product.
