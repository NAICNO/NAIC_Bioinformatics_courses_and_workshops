Using deep learning models to predict pathogenicity
===================================================

Why use deep learning?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deep learning algorithms excel at identifying complex patterns in large
datasets.

.. Note::

   -  Parameters used in artificial neurons are known weights and biases
   -  Weights and biases of a model represent the importance of each
      connection in the model and determine how it transforms the input
      data to output
   -  These parameters are initialized randomly at first.
   
      -  When running input data through the network for the first time,
         results will be terrible
      -  Therefore input data is cycled through the network many times,
         readjusting the parameters little by little (optimization
         algorithms)
   
   -  Readjustment of parameters allows the model to accurately transform
      input data to the desired output
   
      -  i.e., Readjustment process improves the accuracy of model
         predictions :::
