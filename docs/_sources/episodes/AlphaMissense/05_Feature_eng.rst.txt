Feature engineering
===================

Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into new
features that can better represent the underlying patterns and
relationships

-  Transforms the amino acid sequences of proteins containing missense
   variants into representations that can be effectively processed by
   deep-learning models
-  This step enhances the amino acid sequence datasetsâ€™ ability to
   represent the underlying patterns and relationships
-  Allows the model to gain more insight from sequence data and make
   accurate predictions
