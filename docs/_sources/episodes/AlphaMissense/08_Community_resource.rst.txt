AlphaMissense community resource
================================

-  71 million missense variant predictions covering the human proteome -
   ``missense proteome data``

-  For each UniProt canonical isoform, first generate all possible SNVs
   and then keep SNVs that change the protein seq

-  Gene-level AlphaMissense pathogenicity predictions

   -  which is the average pathogenicity of all possible missense
      variants in a gene
   -  216 million possible single amino acid substitutions across 19,233
      human proteins (UniProt canonical isoforms)

   -  Out of 71 million missense variant covering the human proteome

      -  Likely pathogenic: 32% (22.8 million) are and
      -  Likely benign: 57% (40.9 million)

   -  Classification cutoff: 90% precision using the ClinVar dataset

   .. rubric:: Applications
      :name: applications

   -  AlphaMissense findings coupled with donstream functional
      experiments improve the current understanding of clinically
      actionable genes and variants


   - Expedite understanding of the molecular effects of variants on protein function.
   
   - Prioritise rare disease relevant variants
   
   - Improve the diagnostic yield of rare genetic diseases
