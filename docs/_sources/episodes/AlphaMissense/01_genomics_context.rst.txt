Genomics context of missense variants
=====================================

-  Missense variants alter the amino acid sequence that could affect the
   protein structure potentially leading to diseases
-  Missense variants leading to diseases are known as pathogenic
   missense variants
-  Missense variants with limited effects not leading to diseases are
   known as bening missense variants

   .. rubric:: Challenges in the current clinical setting

   -  Understanding the pathogenicity (or bening status) of missense
      variants is a major challenge in the current clinical setting
   -  Over the years, scientists have identified a long list of disease
      associated genes.

      -  Differentiating pathogenic and bening missense variants in
         these set of genes is also a challenging task

      pathogenicity predicting tools to one score

   .. rubric:: Limitations in current methods
      :name: limitations-in-current-methods

   -  Current tools rely on applying hard-thresholds (cut-off scores)
   -  Practically, these hard-thresholds are used only as guides

      -  For example, VEP user manual strongly recommends using an
         appropriate cut-off depending on the experiment and dataset.

   -  These tools are used to predict the pathogenicity of other variant
      types (not only missense)

      -  Tools have shown stronger pathogenicity scores for more harmful
         variant types (stop-gain, stop-loss, splice-site) compared to
         missense variants

   -  Predicting the pathogenicity of missense variants remains a
      challenging task.
   -  A large majority of currently identified missense variants fall to
      the category - *variants with uncertain significance*
